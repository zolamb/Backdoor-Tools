This repo includes the following:
1) backdoor.py - The file the target runs on their machine to open the backdoor connection.
2) backdoor_listener.py - The file that runs on the local machine to complete the connection
			  between backdoor.py on the target and our local machine.
3) eav.py - The various attack vectors the backdoor_listener can execute.

Capabilities:
1) Navigate directories
2) Download files from target
3) Upload files to target
4) Execute custom attacks on target

This backdoor was designed to be scalable. As you come up with ideas for attacks that
can be run on the target machine, all you need to do is add that function to the
eav (Execute Attack Vectors) file, and add the source and executable for that attack
to the vectors and vectors_source files respectively. Each eav works by simply uploading
the executable, running the executable, removing the executable, and downloading the results.
